# Revenue Allocation

Animak is a business entity community based on each NFT's. Animak characters are created by the community, and the revenue is returned to the community, which earns profit and revenue, via donating and earning money by having Animak characters appear in other games. By growing to a successful character, you can grow your business. And then Token holders and NFT owners, who are in charge of governance, will receive revenue. This is exactly DAO community.
