# Derivative Creation

Each ANIMAK has a license that is set by the owner of the Animak or by the Animak community. If an Animak allows derivative works, you are free to do so. Please refer to the license of each Animak for information on profit and terms of use. There are many Animaks that allow derivative works freely, as the community is larger when derivative works are freely available.
